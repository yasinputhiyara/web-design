                        <h3>The Saint of Calcutta</h3>
                        <p>Mother Teresa, born Anjez√´ Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, was an Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. She founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation dedicated to serving the poor, sick, and dying. Her work among the poverty-stricken residents of Calcutta (now Kolkata) made her one of the most recognized humanitarian figures of the 20th century.</p>
                        
                        <div class="bio-highlight">
                            "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus."
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Mother Teresa's life was characterized by unwavering commitment to helping those in extreme poverty. Her order established hospices, soup kitchens, schools, orphanages, and homes for people suffering from HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. Her humanitarian efforts earned her numerous accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, which she accepted "in the name of the poor."</p>
                        
                        <p>After nearly 50 years of service, Mother Teresa passed away on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87. Her legacy continues through the Missionaries of Charity, which has expanded to over 130 countries. In 2016, she was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by Pope Francis, recognizing her extraordinary service and devotion to the marginalized and vulnerable.</p>

                        <p>Born in Skopje (now North Macedonia), Anjez√´ Gonxhe Bojaxhiu grew up in a devout Catholic family. At the age of 12, she first felt the call to religious life. By 18, she decided to become a missionary and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, where she learned English to prepare for her mission work in India.</p>

                        <p>After arriving in India in 1929, she began her novitiate in Darjeeling. She took her first religious vows in 1931 and chose the name Teresa. For almost 20 years, she taught at St. Mary's School for girls in Calcutta, eventually becoming the principal. During this time, she was deeply moved by the suffering she witnessed in the city's slums.</p>

                        <p>On September 10, 1946, while traveling to Darjeeling for a retreat, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within a call." She felt Christ asking her to serve him among the poorest of the poor. After receiving permission to leave her convent, she began working in the slums of Calcutta in 1948, wearing her now-iconic white sari with blue trim.</p>

                        <p>In 1950, Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, dedicated to serving the "poorest of the poor." The order began with just 13 members in Calcutta and expanded globally over time. She established Nirmal Hriday (Pure Heart) in 1952, a home for the dying, and later opened numerous facilities worldwide. Her work continued to expand until her death in 1997, by which time her order included over 4,000 sisters operating 610 missions in 123 countries.</p>
